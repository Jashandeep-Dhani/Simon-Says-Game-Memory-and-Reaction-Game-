    <h1>Simon Says Game</h1>
    <p class="How-to-play">
      <strong>Simon Says</strong> is a fun and simple game of listening and
      quick reactions.<br />
      Here's how to play: One person is chosen to be
      <strong>"Simon"</strong> and gives instructions to the other players.<br />
      If the instruction starts with <strong>"Simon says"</strong>, players must
      follow it.<br />
      <strong>Example:</strong> “Simon says touch your nose” - everyone touches
      their nose.<br />
      If the instruction <strong>doesn't</strong> start with “Simon says,”
      players <strong>must not</strong> follow it.<br />
      <strong>Example:</strong> “Jump!” - anyone who jumps is out.<br />
      Players who follow a command incorrectly or miss a correct one are
      <strong>eliminated</strong>.<br />
      The <strong>last player remaining</strong> is the winner!<br />
      It's a great game to test <strong>attention</strong> and
      <strong>listening skills</strong>!
